    <h1>Trinidadian Boiled Corn</h1>
    <p style="font-family:cursive; padding-left: 5%; color:rgb(203, 212, 25);">Ready for a corn on the cob recipe like no other? Trinidadian boiled corn is simmered in a flavorful broth of coconut milk, fiery habanero peppers, and fresh herbs until it clings to every kernel. </p>

            Trinidadian boiled corn is more of an in-between meal and commonly enjoyed on its own, but sometimes served as a side dish. 
            <br><br>
            The subtle flavor of corn on the cob gets dressed up with a heavy hand of earthy fresh herbs such as culantro (an herb similar to cilantro and known to Trinidadians as shado beni), thyme, and chives. Lots of garlic and few scotch bonnet or habanero take this corn to new heights. 
            <br><br>
            All the flavors are married in a coconut milk broth and cooked down on the stovetop until the broth has reduced enough that it coats the corn. Some people make it without coconut milk and boil the corn in water instead.
            <br><br>
            Eating Trini boiled corn is an experience. Enjoying the luscious coconut milk broth with each bite of corn is all a part of the fun of this dish. And you should only eat this corn with your hands; licking your fingers after is absolutely necessary.

    <h2 class="recipe">Cooking Trinidadian Boiled Corn</h2>
    <p class="recipe"> You will need a pot wide enough to hold the corn, but also deep enough so there is space to turn the corn as it cooks. You can leave the corn whole or cut it in halves, or even quarters. 
        <br><br>
        The corn found in Trinidad and Tobago is a little tougher and needs to boil for about 1 hour to soften it up. However, the corn here in the United States from grocery stores or farmers markets is soft and juicy even without cooking, so it does not need to cook as long. Somewhere around 30 to 40 minutes is enough for the flavors of the aromatics in the broth to meld.

        <h2 class="recipe">How to Choose the Best Corn</h2>
        <p class="recipe">
            For this recipe fresh corn on the cob works best. Frozen corn retains moisture after it thaws, leaving the corn lacking that nice crisp exterior. I like to purchase corn from a farmers' market because I can always find the best prices. If you can't get to a farmers' market, then the grocery store is the next best for fresh corn. 
            <br><br>
            When choosing corn at a market or grocery store, you will typically find a large trash bin next to the corn. This is so you can shuck the husk off the corn to make sure it is not old, has worms, or contains mold. Here are my tips for choosing the best corn:
            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>
                    The corn should feel firm and heavy relative to its size. That's how you know it's full of juice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The husk should be bright green and feel slightly damp or moist, especially near the tip where most of the tassels (also known as silk) are.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look for corn with husks that tightly hug the kernels. The tassels at the very tip should be light to golden brown. If they are black and extra wet, then pick another ear of corn.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="recipe">What Type of Coconut Milk to Use</h2>
        <p class="recipe">
            Trinidadian boiled corn is usually made with fresh coconut milk, but for convenience canned coconut milk works perfectly. I don't recommend using light or sweetened coconut milk. Try to find ones that are full fat and have the least amount of additives. A few of my favorite brands: <a href="https://www.instacart.com/products/36270-chaokoh-coconut-milk-13-5-fl-oz"target="_blank">Chaokoh</a>, <a href="https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=153518"target="_blank">Grace</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Organic-Coconut-Milk/dp/B01KT49KNO"target="_blank">Trader Joes</a>, and <a href="https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=17090448"target="_blank">Thai Kitchen</a>.

        <h2 class="recipe">Method</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol class="recipe">
            <li>Shuck The Corn:</li>
        <img src="images/corn6.webp" alt="Corn Image">
        <p class="recipe">
            Remove the husk from the corn by holding corn firmly in one hand and firmly peeling the leaves and silk fibers back from the pointed end to the stem end. Yank the husk off the base and discard. Continue to peel until you can see the corn kernels. Repeat this for each ear. 
            <br><br>
            Rinse each ear under running water and remove any straggling silk fibers that are still hanging on.
            <br><br>
        </p>
            <li>Halve the corn:</li>
            <p class="recipe">
                On a cutting board, use a large chef's knife and cut the corn into halves. If the corn is small enough you can even just snap it in half using your hands.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <li>Bring the liquids to a boil, then simmer:</li>
            <p class="recipe"> In a deep and wide pot, add the coconut milk and water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
                <br><br>
                Add the butter, garlic, thyme, culantro, chives, habanero, salt, and black pepper. Let it simmer for 10 minutes.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <img src="images/corn7.webp" alt="Corn Image">
            <li>Boil the corn:</li>
            <p class="recipe"> Add the corn and let it all simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Turn the corn every 8 to 10 minutes using metal tongs or a fork. Be careful not to burst the pepper in the simmer liquid if you don't want it spicy. 
                <br><br>
                You'll know it's ready when the coconut milk is reduced enough that it is thick and coats the corn heavily. You don't want it like a soup, but more so reduced with some gravy.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <p class="recipe"> Divide the corn and coconut milk between bowls. This can be served by itself or as a side dish. 
                <br><br>
                Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
                <br><br>
                To reheat, place the corn in the same pot used to cook it and add 2 tablespoons of water. Over medium-low heat, bring to a simmer and heat for 5-10 minutes. 
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, you can reheat in the microwave for 3-4 minutes until warmed through.
